You have been tasked with constructing a basic simulation to investigate the dynamics of the system.\n\nEach ship in the fleet is to be modeled as a point mass, with a thrust angle (theta) and a constant thrust force pointing in the direction of the thrust angle. During operation the thrust angle can change, however the thrust force remains constant. The diagram below shows the setup.\n\n<img src=\"Diag.png\">\n\n\n\n\nEach ship will also have a drag coefficient ($C_d$). The drag force acting on a ship can be calculated as:\n\n$D = (1/2)C_dV^2$  https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/drag-force.html\n\nwhere $D$ is the drag force,  $C_d$ is the drag coefficient and $V$ is the ship's velocity. The drag force is applied in the opposite direction to the ship's velocity.\n\nNote that the Drag equation does not include a term for the area as the ship is being modeled by a point mass.\n\nIt is intended that the thrust force of the ship will result in acceleration of the point mass resulting in motion of the \"ship\"\n\nThe simulation should be constrained to 2-dimensions (X,Y), as shown in the diagram\n\n## Q1 (a) \nConstruct a python class to represent an individual ship. The constructor of the class should take the following arguments in order to define the dynamics of the ship:\n\n- Starting X position\n- Starting Y position\n- Ship mass (in kg)\n- Thrust Force (in N)\n- Ship drag coefficient ($C_d$)\n\nThe class should contain a list of x positions, and a list of y positions to keep track of the ships position at each timestamp. In order to evolve the simulation the class should contain an `updatePosition()` method which calculates the total acceleration experienced by the ship and the resulting X,Y position of the ship after a single timestep. The method should then append this X,Y position to the x-position and y-position lists respectivly. **The length of the simulations timestep should be no longer than 0.1s**.\n\nAdditionally the class should contain a method for setting the current thrust angle (theta). It is recommended to work in radians, however this is not required. The thrust angle (theta) is mesured from the x axis.\n\nIt can be assumed that the initial acceleration and velocity of the ship is 0.\n\nTo test your class, create an instance and run it's `updatePosition(dt)` function several hundred times.\nUse matplotlib to generate a plot showing the motion of the ship.\n\nPlay around with the parameters of the class instance, as well as various heading angles,  to make sure the output graph makes sense.\n\nFor visualisation purposes it will be useful to set the scale of the X and Y axis in the output plot to be equal:\n`plt.axis(\"equal\")`\n\n\nA typical ship might have parameters similar to:\n- Mass of 200,000,000 kg\n- Thrust force of 1MN\n- Drag Coefficient of 1000\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport math\nclass ship:\n    def __init__(self, startingx, startingy, mass, thrust,
